### Tube Screamer

The Ibanez Tube Screamer is an overdrive pedal first released in the late 1970s. The pedal is widely used and often associated with players such as Stevie Ray Vaughan, John Mayer, Mike McCready, and Trey Anastasio, among others. The Tube Screamer's "Drive", "Tone", and "Level" knobs adjust the gain, treble, and output volume of the pedal, respectively. 

The effects alter the instrument sound by clipping the signal (pushing it past its maximum, which shears off the peaks and troughs of the signal waves), adding sustain and harmonic and inharmonic overtones and leading to a compressed sound that is often described as "warm" and "dirty", depending on the type and intensity of distortion used. The terms distortion and overdrive are often used interchangeably; where a distinction is made, distortion is a more extreme version of the effect than overdrive. 

Popular versions of the pedal include:
* TS808
* TS9
* TS10

The Tube Screamer overdrive is produced using two silicon diodes in anti-parallel arrangement into the negative feedback circuit of an operational amplifier ("op-amp") circuit, to produce soft, symmetrical distortion of the input waveform. When the output exceeds the forward volt drop of the diodes the amplifier gain is much lower, effectively limiting the output to + and - one diode volt-drop, although due to the exponential I-V curve of the diodes this is not a hard limit. A "drive" potentiomenter in the feedback path provides variable gain.

Much has been made of the operational amplifier chips used in the various versions of the Tube Screamer pedal, and several "fairy tales" about the merits of these devices have been written on the subject. The JRC4558D chip is well-regarded by some. In reality, the type of op-amp has little to do with the sound of the pedal, which is dominated by the diodes in the op-amp's feedback path.

The Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi

A fuzz pedal or "fuzzbox" is a type of overdrive pedal that clips a sound-wave until it is nearly a squarewave, resulting in a heavily distorted or "fuzzy" sound.

### Dyna Comp

One of the most popular compressors of all time. Produced by MXR since the 1970s, the pedal produces a dynamic range compression effect. The two controls knobs "Output" and "Sensitivity" determine the output level and amount of compression, respectively. 

Dynamic range compression (DRC) or simply compression is an audio signal processing operation that reduces the volume of loud sounds or amplifies quiet sounds, thus reducing or compressing an audio signal's dynamic range. 

### Phase 90

Introduced by MXR in 1972, the Phase 90 was the first pedal launched by the company. Speed knob varies the rate of the phase sweep.  

A phaser is an electronic sound processor used to filter a signal by creating a series of peaks and troughs in the frequency spectrum. The position of the peaks and troughs of the waveform being affected is typically modulated by an internal low-frequency oscillator so that they vary over time, creating a sweeping effect. Phasers fall under the category of modulation effects. 

## Notes  
All pedals designs in this project have been designed to used a 3PDT switch to include true bypass and neglect the inclusion of a 9V battery to simplify the wiring and soldering of the pedals.
